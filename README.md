# Agrosica JSON-RPC Client and Server

Yes, yet another JSON-RPC client and server implementation.

## Why should I care?

Because the client works equally well in Node.js and the browser, and if this client communicates with this server, *magic* happens and you can both define and use your RPC functions in a natural, Javascript-y way. (Nicer than the existing JSONRPC clients and servers, we think!)

Note that this is an initial release of the libraries, the API will be tidied up slightly shortly.

## Install

    npm install agro-jsonrpc-server
    npm install agro-jsonrpc-client
